# Face-Tracker
In a nutshell, it tracks your face in your webcam
I've used the Open CV (Computer Visoion) function in python to make this. It captures the images that the webcam receives and makes a rectangle in the detcted face. The trained AI that i used it's a xml file that i got in a github repositorie that is in this link: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades , and I used the one that recognize faces. The code is commented so you can know exactly what all parts work.
